The classic hangman game.

The script selects a random english word from the provided url, and starts the game. 
You have to guess the word, and you can only see one random letter in the beginning. 
You can fail up to 3 times, if you fail 4, the hang man is completely shown, and you die.

OBS: The scrip would be far more efficient if it would not depend on an internet connection 
to download the word every time you run the script, but this is just for educational purposes.
Better would be to just create a list with all the words inside the script. 
On the other hand, this allows us to search for words in different urls.
